# Abstract Extraction Verification

## Summary

The rolling window extraction mechanism has been successfully verified to work with abstract extraction mode. The implementation correctly:

1. **Handles Abstract Mode**: Uses the abstract-specific configuration (single chunk, no overlap)
2. **Extracts Multiple Fields**: Successfully processes all fields in one API call
3. **Returns Structured Data**: Each field includes value, confidence, and citations
4. **Provides Accurate Results**: Correctly identifies paper types, objectives, and findings

## Test Results

### Test 1: Single Field Extraction
```json
{
  "paper_type": {
    "value": "Research Article",
    "confidence": 0.98,
    "citations": [
      {
        "text": "This research article presents...",
        "location": "Abstract, first sentence"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Multiple Fields Extraction
```json
{
  "paper_type": {
    "value": "Research Article",
    "confidence": 0.98,
    "citations": [{"text": "This research article investigates...", "location": "Abstract, first sentence"}]
  },
  "key_objective": {
    "value": "Identify proteins with significant expression changes during TB treatment",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "citations": [{"text": "We aimed to identify proteins...", "location": "Abstract, objectives"}]
  },
  "key_finding": {
    "value": "Proteins related to antimicrobial defense and tissue remodeling (TSP4, TIMP-2, LBP) showed significant changes",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "citations": [{"text": "Our findings revealed that proteins...", "location": "Abstract, results"}]
  }
}
```

## Key Features Working

1. **Streaming Updates**: Progress updates are sent during extraction
2. **Structured Output**: Uses `generateObject` to ensure valid JSON
3. **Citation Tracking**: Each extraction includes supporting text and location
4. **Confidence Scores**: Provides confidence levels for each extracted value
5. **Field Type Support**: Correctly handles different field types (select, text, etc.)

## Configuration for Abstract Mode

```typescript
abstract: {
  chunkSize: 2000,  // Process abstracts in one chunk
  overlap: 0,       // No overlap needed
  maxChunks: 1      // Single chunk processing
}
```

This configuration ensures that abstracts are processed efficiently in a single pass, which is appropriate given their typical length of 200-400 words.
