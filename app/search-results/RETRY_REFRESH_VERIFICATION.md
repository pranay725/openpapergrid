# Retry & Refresh Functionality Verification

## Overview

We have successfully implemented comprehensive retry and refresh capabilities for both Abstract and Full Text extraction modes. The system now supports:

1. **Smart Retry Logic** - Automatic retry with configurable max attempts
2. **Individual Paper Refresh** - Re-extract all fields for a single paper
3. **Individual Field Refresh** - Re-extract a single field for a paper
4. **Force Refresh** - Clear cache and re-fetch data

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced `useFullTextExtraction` Hook

```typescript
// New capabilities added:
- extractSingleField() - Extract just one field for a paper
- retryExtraction() - Retry failed extraction with retry count tracking
- processWork() with forceRefresh parameter - Clear cache and re-extract
- retryCount state - Track retry attempts per paper
- MAX_RETRIES constant - Configurable retry limit (default: 3)
```

### 2. UI Components

#### TableRow Component
- Shows retry button when extraction fails (with remaining attempts)
- Shows refresh button when extraction is complete
- Visual indicators for retry count

#### AIResponseCell Component  
- Individual field refresh button
- Confidence-based visual feedback
- Edit capabilities preserved

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery

#### Abstract Mode
1. Try OpenAlex abstract
2. Try reconstructing from inverted index
3. Try web scraping via Firecrawl
4. Show error with retry option

#### Full Text Mode
1. Try PMC (if PMID available)
2. Try PDF parsing (if PDF URL available)
3. Try web scraping via Firecrawl
4. Show error with retry option

### 4. User Actions

#### Retry Failed Extraction
- Click "Retry (X left)" button on failed papers
- Automatically clears error state
- Forces data refresh
- Updates retry count

#### Refresh Successful Extraction
- Click "Re-extract" button on completed papers
- Clears all cached data for that paper
- Re-runs entire extraction pipeline
- Useful for updating stale data

#### Refresh Individual Field
- Click "Refresh" button on any field
- Re-extracts just that field
- Uses cached text data if available
- Faster than full re-extraction

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Abstract Extraction
- ✅ Papers with abstracts extract successfully
- ✅ Papers without abstracts attempt scraping
- ✅ Failed scraping shows retry option
- ✅ Successful extraction shows refresh option
- ✅ Individual fields can be refreshed

### 2. Full Text Extraction  
- ✅ PMC papers extract full text
- ✅ PDF papers use LlamaParse
- ✅ Fallback to Firecrawl for web pages
- ✅ Failed extraction shows retry with count
- ✅ Refresh clears cache and re-fetches

### 3. Error Recovery
- ✅ Network errors can be retried
- ✅ API rate limits handled gracefully
- ✅ Maximum retry limit prevents infinite loops
- ✅ Clear error messaging to users

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching** - Full text data cached to avoid re-fetching
2. **Selective Updates** - Single field refresh doesn't re-fetch text
3. **Abort Controllers** - Cancel in-flight requests properly
4. **Streaming Updates** - Real-time progress feedback

## Usage Examples

### Retry Failed Extraction
```typescript
// Automatically triggered by retry button
handleRetryExtraction(result) {
  retryExtraction(result, customFields);
}
```

### Refresh All Fields
```typescript
// Force refresh clears cache
handleRefreshExtraction(result) {
  processWork(result, customFields, true);
}
```

### Refresh Single Field
```typescript
// Efficient single field update
handleExtractSingleField(result, field) {
  extractSingleField(result, field, true);
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Retry** - Retry all failed papers at once
2. **Auto-Retry** - Configurable automatic retry on failure
3. **Retry Delay** - Exponential backoff for rate limits
4. **Partial Success** - Continue extraction even if some fields fail
5. **Progress Persistence** - Resume interrupted extractions
