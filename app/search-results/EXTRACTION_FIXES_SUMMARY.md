# Extraction System Fixes Summary

## 1. Mode Switch Fix
**Problem**: Re-extract button not working when switching between Abstract/Full Text modes
**Solution**: 
- Added `modeRef` to track current mode in useFullTextExtraction hook
- Clear all extraction data when mode changes
- Ensures fresh extraction with correct mode

## 2. Schema Validation Fix
**Problem**: "Invalid schema for response_format" error from OpenAI
**Solution**:
- Fixed Zod schema generation to use proper types based on field.type
- Changed from `z.any()` to specific types:
  - text → `z.string()`
  - number → `z.number()`
  - boolean → `z.boolean()`
  - select → `z.enum()` or `z.string()`
  - multi_select → `z.array(z.enum())` or `z.array(z.string())`
  - date → `z.string()`
  - url → `z.string()`

## 3. Retry & Refresh Capabilities
**Features Added**:
- Smart retry with max 3 attempts
- Individual paper refresh (re-extract all fields)
- Individual field refresh
- Force refresh option to clear cache
- Visual indicators for retry count

## 4. Error Handling Improvements
- Clear error messages with context
- Shows attempted sources (PMC, PDF, Firecrawl)
- Graceful degradation with retry options
- Proper abort controller cleanup

## 5. Performance Optimizations
- Text data caching to avoid re-fetching
- Single field refresh without full re-extraction
- Streaming updates for real-time progress
- Efficient mode switching with data cleanup

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Abstract extraction works
- [x] Full text extraction works
- [x] Mode switching clears previous data
- [x] Re-extract button works after mode change
- [x] Retry button appears on failure
- [x] Individual field refresh works
- [x] Schema validation passes for all field types
- [x] Error messages are informative

## Current Status
All major extraction flows are working correctly with proper error handling and retry capabilities.
