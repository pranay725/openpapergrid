# Search Results Refactoring Notes

## Overview
The search results page has been refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Component Structure
- **SearchResultsClientRefactored.tsx**: Main component (simplified)
- **components/**: Extracted UI components
  - `ResultsTable/`: Table-related components
  - `FilterSidebar/`: Filter components
  - `ConfigurationManagement/`: Configuration UI
  - `FieldManagement/`: Field management dialogs
  - `SearchHeader.tsx`: Search bar component
  - `Skeletons.tsx`: Loading states

### 2. Business Logic Separation
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks
  - `useSearchFilters`: Filter state management
  - `useSearchResults`: Search API integration
  - `useAIResponses`: AI field extraction logic
- **utils/**: Helper functions
  - `filterHelpers`: URL building and filter parsing
  - `mockDataGenerators`: Mock data generation
  - `textHelpers`: Text manipulation utilities
- **types/**: TypeScript type definitions

### 3. Benefits
- Better code organization
- Reusable components
- Easier testing
- Improved maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns

## Migration Status
- ✅ Components extracted
- ✅ Hooks created
- ✅ Utils organized
- ✅ Types defined
- ✅ Filter sidebar integrated
- ✅ Pagination component added
- ⚠️ Original file still exists (search-results-client.tsx)

## Next Steps
1. Remove original search-results-client.tsx once confirmed working
2. Complete field settings and field editor modals
3. Add unit tests for hooks and utils
4. Document component APIs
5. Performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading)
