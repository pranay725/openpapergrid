# Extraction Mechanism Refactor Summary

## Overview
The extraction mechanism has been refactored to provide a better user experience with a toggle between Abstract Only and Full Text modes, improved configuration management, and a unified extraction controls interface.

## Key Changes

### 1. New ExtractionControls Component
- **Location**: `app/search-results/components/ExtractionControls.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Toggle button for switching between "Abstract Only" and "Full Text" extraction modes
  - Integrated AI provider/model selector
  - Extract/Cancel button with status indicators
  - Clear mode descriptions for user understanding

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Management Dialog
- **Location**: `app/search-results/components/ConfigurationManagement/ConfigurationDialog.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Tabbed interface for "Manage Fields" and "Create New Configuration"
  - Add/remove/enable/disable fields within the dialog
  - Visual field management with drag handles (UI only)
  - Save configuration changes
  - Create new configurations with fields

### 3. Updated Extraction Hook
- **Location**: `app/search-results/hooks/useFullTextExtraction.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `mode` parameter to support 'abstract' or 'fulltext' extraction
  - Abstract mode bypasses full text fetching and uses only the abstract
  - Full text mode fetches and uses complete paper content when available

### 4. Main Component Updates
- **Location**: `app/search-results/SearchResultsClientRefactored.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced separate AI provider selector and extract button with ExtractionControls
  - Replaced multiple field management modals with unified ConfigurationDialog
  - Added extraction mode state management
  - Improved configuration change handling

## User Flow Improvements

### Extraction Mode Selection
1. Users can easily toggle between Abstract Only and Full Text modes
2. Clear visual feedback on which mode is active
3. Descriptive text explaining the difference between modes

### Configuration Management
1. Single dialog for all configuration-related tasks
2. Tabbed interface reduces confusion
3. Direct field management without multiple nested modals
4. Clear visual hierarchy and actions

### Visual Design
- Cohesive gray-bordered boxes for controls
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Clear button states and hover effects
- Improved information architecture

## Benefits
1. **Better UX**: Clearer controls and fewer modals
2. **Flexibility**: Easy switching between extraction modes
3. **Performance**: Abstract-only mode is faster for quick screening
4. **Maintainability**: Consolidated configuration management
5. **Accessibility**: Better visual hierarchy and clearer labels
