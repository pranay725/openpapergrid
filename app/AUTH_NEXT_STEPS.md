# Authentication Implementation - Next Steps

## Current Status âœ…
1. **Basic Auth Setup**: Supabase auth is configured and working
2. **Login/Signup Pages**: Created and functional
3. **Auth Context**: Set up with user state management
4. **Rate Limiting**: Middleware and utilities created
5. **UI Components**: Updated to show auth state
6. **API Protection**: Full text route requires authentication
7. **Usage Tracking**: Basic tracking for anonymous users

## Immediate Next Steps ðŸš€

### 1. Test Authentication Flow
Visit `/test-auth` to verify:
- [ ] Login works correctly
- [ ] User details are displayed
- [ ] Logout functionality works
- [ ] Redirect after login works

### 2. Apply Database Migration
When Supabase is connected:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 4. Test Rate Limiting
- [ ] Make 10+ searches as anonymous user
- [ ] Verify rate limit message appears
- [ ] Check that authenticated users have higher limits

### 5. Implement OAuth Providers
In Supabase Dashboard:
- [ ] Enable Google OAuth
- [ ] Enable GitHub OAuth
- [ ] Add redirect URLs

## Feature Implementation Checklist

### Anonymous Users (No Login Required)
- [x] Can search papers (10/hour limit)
- [x] Can view up to 50 results per search
- [x] Can extract from abstracts (5/hour limit)
- [x] See usage indicators
- [x] Get upgrade prompts when near limits
- [ ] Results show "Sign in to see all X results" if > 50

### Authenticated Users
- [x] Unlimited searches (1000/day soft limit)
- [x] View all search results
- [x] Abstract extraction (500/day)
- [x] Full text extraction (100/day)
- [ ] Save configurations
- [ ] Export results
- [ ] View usage dashboard

### UI Polish
- [x] Lock icon on full text mode for anonymous
- [x] "Sign in to Extract" button when not authenticated
- [x] Usage limit indicators
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Success messages after login
- [ ] Better error handling

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Anonymous User Journey
1. Search for "CRISPR"
2. Try abstract extraction (should work)
3. Switch to full text mode (should prompt login)
4. Make 10+ searches (should hit rate limit)
5. Click sign up from rate limit message

### 2. New User Sign Up
1. Click "Sign up" from header
2. Create account with email/password
3. Verify redirect to original page
4. Check full features are available

### 3. Returning User
1. Click "Log in"
2. Enter credentials
3. Verify session persists
4. Test full text extraction

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Track These Metrics
- Sign up conversion rate from:
  - Rate limit messages
  - Full text lock prompts
  - Header CTA
- Feature usage by auth state
- Average extractions per user
- Session duration

### Error Scenarios to Handle
- [ ] Supabase service down
- [ ] Rate limit database errors
- [ ] OAuth provider failures
- [ ] Session expiry during extraction

## Future Enhancements
1. **Tiered Plans**: Free, Pro, Enterprise
2. **Team Accounts**: Shared configurations
3. **API Keys**: For programmatic access
4. **Usage Dashboard**: Visual analytics
5. **Email Notifications**: Usage alerts
6. **Saved Searches**: Email alerts for new papers

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Comment out middleware auth checks
2. Set `isAuthenticated` to true in components
3. Disable rate limiting in middleware
4. Monitor error logs and fix issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 15%+ of anonymous users sign up
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] Full text extraction working for auth users
- [ ] Positive user feedback on auth flow
