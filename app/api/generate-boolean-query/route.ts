const BOOLEAN_QUERY_PROMPT = `You are generating a Boolean search query optimized for OpenAlex full-text search. Follow these instructions carefully:

Use only Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to connect keywords.

Use quotes for exact phrases (e.g., "gene therapy").

Use parentheses to group synonyms or related terms.

Do not include any field prefixes like author:, year:, journal:, etc.

Do not suggest filters for publication years, author names, journal titles, or affiliations.

Focus only on keywords and concepts that would appear in the full text of the paper.

Make the query comprehensive by including synonyms, acronyms, spelling variants, and related terms, but avoid introducing unrelated false positives.

Use NOT to exclude likely sources of irrelevant results (e.g., mouse models when the focus is human studies).

Keep the query readable with clean logical structure and correct parentheses.

Goal:
Maximize recall without sacrificing precision â€” include as many valid synonyms and phrasings as necessary, but avoid adding noise.`;
